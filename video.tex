\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item theme: informative code along. (coding with explanations and principles in voiced over).

\item ideas: the general features of the language that are must know. Maybe not high level material but the stuff to get any basic program running.

\item code examples: lists, loops, procedures, types, as well as general material needed to create the file 

\item the demo will be at the very end after we have explained everything in the video, 
we will show how they all can work together to make an beginner/intermediate program like ours.

\item this part is still in the works. Maybe OBS screen record.
