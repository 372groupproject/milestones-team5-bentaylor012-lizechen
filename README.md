## Language: ICON

There are two ways to running icon files.

### (1) **icon \*.ico** (Use this one in our repository)

Run the project by typing "make" in the corresponding directory.

### (2) **icont \*.icn**

If we want to use **icont command**, we just need to modify all **\*.ico** to **\*.icn**.

Then run command "**icont \*.icn**", and an executable file will be built.
